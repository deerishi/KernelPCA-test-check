KernelPCA-test-check
====================

In this code I am trying to distinguish between 2 sets of data using  KernelPCA using shogun libraries.
The input data are 2 circles.
The input data is generated from the python script circle_data.py, which is then being imported into the KernelPCA script.
The Kernel used is a gaussian kernel.
